# Stark Theme

Stark is more of a theme template than an actual theme. It includes a pretty extensive Admin panel to allow general layout configuration, but it does not contain any real Typography, Colour or other layout considerations.

It was designed with a 960 grid in mind, to ensure pleasing ratio between content and sidebar, etc.
